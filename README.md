### ML-churn-telephone

This repository shows a briefly summary of the process of a data science project.

We are going to be working in a churn prediction project. We have to find out wich clients are going to leave the telephone service during the next month.

This repo only contains the notebooks and the scripts for the automatization of the process, all the client's data is not public.

The project is divided in 3 folders:

1- EDA --> here are the notebooks of the exploratory data analisis and also the feature engineering part.

2- Modeling --> machine learning models testing and selection.

3- Automatization --> python scripts to make all the steps of the process in a single run.
